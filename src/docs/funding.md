# Funding for Django Commons projects

Django Commons does not place restrictions on projects' ability to seek outside sponsorship or funding. You are welcome to seek sponsors for your project through whatever method you choose. At this time, Django Commons is not able to manage your funding for you, so any fundraising you do will need to be managed by the project's maintainers.

## Thanks.dev

We know we have a few projects who seek sponsorship on [Thanks.dev](https://thanks.dev/home). We have discovered an issue with Thanks.dev that may impact your desire to seek sponsorship through them.

With Thanks.dev, the funding for a project goes to the project's GitHub organization. For Django Commons projects, this means the funding is allocated to the Django Commons organization. The Django Commons admins can see which projects the funding is meant to go to, but we cannot see a breakdown of how much should go to each project. Therefore, we don't have a way to know how much of each funding payout should go to the specific projects; we can only see the total amount awarded, and the projects the award is for. We have reached out to Thanks.dev, and as of August 2025, they have no plans to provide a more detailed breakdown of how funds should be awarded.

For projects using Thanks.dev, we will divide the awarded amount evenly among the specified projects. We recommend that projects seek other funding opportunities where the funding is not grouped together with other projects in this way.
