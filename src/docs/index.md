# Django Commons

Django Commons is an organization dedicated to supporting the community's efforts to maintain packages. It seeks to improve the maintenance experience for all contributors; reducing the barrier to entry for new contributors and reducing overhead for existing maintainers.

Django Commons has lofty goals for the future, but it will only be possible with your help:

- Identify and announce packages needing help
- Normalize and support maintainers periodically stepping back
- Support and encourage new contributors to step up
- Provide best practices for package maintainers
- Compensate maintainers
