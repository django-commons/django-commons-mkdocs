## Stewardship

The community seeks to uphold high standards of professionalism in its work and interactions, treating others with respect, and being responsible stewards of open-source resources. This includes being reliable, following through on commitments, and maintaining ethical standards in both code and community engagement.

## Sustainability

The community seeks to make contributing to open source and the community itself a sustainable activity. This involves clear expectations on roles, being supportive of taking breaks and creating space for others. Our processes and code should be documented, be maintainable and easily searchable.
